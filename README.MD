# Neural Network Python

## About
I made this project to put in practice what I learned on the online course Neural Networks Demystified by Welch Labs.

It has a neural network containing 1 hidden layer with 3 neurons to predict test scores by the hours of sleep and study.

## To do
- [ ] Generalize the code to handle N hidden layers and sizes.
